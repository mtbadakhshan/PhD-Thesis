\section{Future Works}

DAGs are used in a range of applications where data flow needs to be depicted. The use of DAGs allows for mapping the relationship between different stages while considering the sequence and dependencies among these stages. Another example for an application of DAGs is in Version Control System (VCS) tools. Tools like Git \cite{gitonline2023} or Mercurial \cite{mercurial} rely on the DAG data structure to depict the evolution history of a project based on its commits. 

Transferring applications such as SCM or VCS to permissionless (public) blockchains eliminates the need for trust in a manager and offers a range of benefits, which we will discuss later in this paper. However, by the nature of permissionless blockchain, miners, monitors, auditors and validators see the plain transactions on the blockchain.  This could reveal the privacy of the data providers  and actors in  ownership transfer  of the data from one to another.  However, those will expose inventory information of different business sectors.  So, for blockchain based SCM, the privacy of data uploader (anonymous problem), and ownership transfer of data (unlinkable problem) is a crucial factor to deploy this technology.
