Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zkSNARKs) are gaining widespread adoption across various applications. Despite significant progress in developing post-quantum secure zkSNARKs, current schemes still encounter notable challenges, particularly regarding computational complexity.
This thesis proposes utilizing the Cantor special basis (Cantor, 1989) to enhance post-quantum secure zkSNARKs operating over binary extension fields. By adopting this basis, the additive fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm employed in Aurora (Ben-Sasson et al., 2019), a plausible post-quantum secure zkSNARK, is optimized by replacing the previously utilized Gao-Mateer FFT (Gao and Mateer, 2010) with the more efficient Cantor FFT  (Cantor, 1989). The implementation demonstrates substantial reductions in computation time for Aurora, indicating potential performance improvements for other zkSNARK systems reliant on additive FFTs. A thorough theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of the Cantor FFT algorithm is provided, including precise counts of required additions, multiplications, and precomputation overhead. Additionally, the FFT call complexity within the rank-1 constraint system (R1CS) encoding is examined for Aurora.
Furthermore, this thesis includes an extensive analysis of the algorithms within Polaris (Fu and Gong, 2022), a plausible post-quantum zkSNARK protocol, by systematically decomposing its components for detailed evaluation. To address the critical need for efficient real-world implementations, a concrete GKR (Goldwasser et al., 2008) arithmetic circuit is proposed for integration into Polaris. Additionally, the efficiency of the FRI protocol (Ben-Sasson et al., 2018) within Polaris is enhanced by eliminating costly field inversion operations.

Finally, as an illustrative example of a privacy-preserving protocol utilizing zkSNARKs, a novel Anonymous Authentication Token (AAT) scheme is proposed. This scheme supports the unlinkable transfer of token ownership (AAT Ownership Transfer or AATOT), including the merging and dividing of tokens in an unlinkable manner. The construction leverages zkSNARK protocols to ensure anonymity, unlinkability, and authentication. Building upon this foundation, the Zupply framework is introduced, a decentralized system designed to maintain directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of authentic data records. Zupply operates atop a permissionless blockchain equipped with smart contracts, offering a trustless environment that preserves participant anonymity and unlinkability. At the same time, the integrity and authenticity of data records are ensured across the entire supply chain ecosystem. Optimized arithmetic circuits are designed and implemented within the Zupply framework to minimize proof sizes and verification costs. Post-quantum secure solutions are concurrently explored to future-proof the framework against quantum computing advancements. The implementation of Zupply is carried out in C++ and Solidity, utilizing two distinct zkSNARK protocols: Groth16 (Groth, 2016) and Aurora. The Groth16 zkSNARK, while vulnerable to quantum attacks, provides computational efficiency and reduced operational costs, thereby demonstrating Zupplyâs practicality for real-world decentralized supply chain management (SCM) systems. In contrast, the Aurora zkSNARK is designed to be plausibly secure against quantum-capable adversaries. A comparative analysis of computation efficiency and proof sizes between these two zkSNARK variants is conducted.

I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Professor Guang Gong, for her unwavering support and guidance throughout my PhD. Her expertise in cryptography and abstract algebra introduced me to the fascinating world of zero-knowledge proofs, an area I knew very little about before starting this journey. She gave me the freedom to explore my own research directions, while always being there to offer advice and encouragement during difficult times. Her kindness and support went beyond academics and created an environment where I could grow both professionally and personally. It has been an honor to be her student, and I will always be grateful for everything I have learned from her.

I am truly grateful to Professor Liqun Chen, Professor Anwar Hasan, Professor Mahesh Tripunitara, and Professor Douglas Stebila for serving on my thesis committee. Their thoughtful feedback and valuable suggestions helped improve the quality of this work. I deeply appreciate the time and effort they dedicated to reviewing my thesis and supporting my progress.

I would like to thank my parents for their unconditional love, support, and belief in me throughout every step of my life. Their sacrifices and values have shaped who I am today. Even from afar, they have always been with me, giving me strength and reminding me to keep going with honesty and perseverance. I dedicate this achievement to them with love and deep appreciation.

Last but not the least, I am incredibly grateful to my girlfriend, Maryam Mottaghi, for her endless support, patience, and love during this journey. She stood by me through all the ups and downs, encouraged me when I struggled, and believed in me when I needed it most. Her presence has been a source of peace and motivation, and sharing this chapter of life with her has been a true gift.

I also wish to express my sincere gratitude to XRP Ledger, BTQ Corporation, and MITACS for their financial support throughout my PhD studies.
